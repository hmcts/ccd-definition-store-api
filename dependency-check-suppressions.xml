            A permission issue was found in Elasticsearch versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 when Field Level Security and Document Level
            Security are disabled and the _aliases, _shrink, or _split endpoints are used . If the elasticsearch.yml file has xpack.security.dls_fls.enabled set to false,
            certain permission checks are skipped when users perform one of the actions mentioned above, to make existing data available under a new index/alias name.
            This could result in an attacker gaining additional permissions against a restricted index.
            https://www.elastic.co/community/security
            Suppressed on the desire to keep elastic search client and server versions in sync until the server can be upgraded.
